# Create iOS App - Step by Step Guide
## Islamic Learning Companion

Since the Xcode project file was causing issues, let's create it the proper way using Xcode itself.

### Method 1: Create New Project in Xcode (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Open Xcode**
2. **Click "Create a new Xcode project"**
3. **Choose "iOS" tab**
4. **Select "App"**
5. **Click "Next"**

### Project Settings:
- **Product Name:** IslamicCompanion
- **Interface:** Storyboard
- **Language:** Swift
- **Bundle Identifier:** com.islamiccompanion.app
- **Team:** (Select your Apple Developer team)
- **Organization Name:** NextEleven Studios
- **Organization Identifier:** com.islamiccompanion

6. **Click "Next"**
7. **Choose location:** Desktop/Islamic App/
8. **Click "Create"**

### Method 2: Use the Simple WebView Template

Once you have the new project:

1. **Replace the ViewController.swift** with the one I created
2. **Replace the Main.storyboard** with the one I created  
3. **Add your web files** to the project
4. **Add app icons**

### Method 3: Use the Web App as PWA (EASIEST)

Actually, let me suggest the EASIEST approach:

1. **Keep your web app as is**
2. **Add it to App Store as a Web App (PWA)**
3. **No Xcode needed!**

This is much simpler and your donors will be happy because nothing changes!

### Which method would you prefer?

1. **Create new Xcode project** (I'll guide you step by step)
2. **Use PWA approach** (Much easier, no Xcode needed)
3. **Try a different approach**

Let me know which you'd like to try!
